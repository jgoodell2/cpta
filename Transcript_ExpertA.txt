hey guys today i'm going to show you how
0:01
to change the oil on this 2006 pontiac
0:04
g6 with a 3.5 liter v6 engine if this
0:08
video is helpful smash that thumbs up
0:11
button like comment subscribe all that
0:13
good
0:14
stuff first thing we're going to do
0:17
is pop the hood
0:20
and also jack up your car
0:23
safely and use a jack stand and i'll
0:26
show you where the drain plug is to
0:27
drain the oil
0:30
all right
0:31
so we got the vehicle jacked up
0:33
uh we're underneath this is the oil pan
0:35
right here
0:37
this is your drain plug so get your
0:41
catch pan ready
0:42
pull that plug out let the oil drain out
0:46
and then right here
0:48
is your oil filter
0:50
so sometimes you can get this off by
0:52
hand sometimes you need to use an oil
0:54
filter wrench or a pair of channel locks
0:58
i'm going to have some links in the
1:00
description below to some amazon
1:02
products that you might like find useful
1:05
you can use them or don't if you do use
1:07
them i get a small cut
1:10
helps me out a little bit
1:14
i'll have a link to these channel locks
1:16
these are the ones i like using for
1:18
getting oil filters when i can't quite
1:20
get them to turn
1:22
um these work really well so i have a
1:24
link to these uh take your oil filter
1:27
off
1:28
and
1:29
pull your pan over so it can run down
1:31
here because it's gonna drip obviously
1:34
and uh
1:36
drain your oil completely put the plug
1:39
back in
1:40
and we'll get ready to put a new oil
1:42
filter on
1:45
now i pour some oil in here
1:49
get some oil on your finger rub it
1:51
around the seal
1:54
and that'll keep this ring from sticking
1:56
to your oil filter adapter
1:59
when you take the old one off make sure
2:02
that the ring didn't stick if you didn't
2:04
do this before
2:07
because you don't want to double ring
2:08
your oil filter
2:12
and you can fill this up as much as you
2:14
want if you want to fill that right to
2:16
the top you can if you don't want to put
2:18
anything in there that's fine
2:21
so
2:22
then you're gonna put your plug back in
2:25
put your new oil filter back on and then
2:27
we'll fill her up with oil
2:30
all right so how tight do you tighten
2:32
this
2:33
um i
2:35
tighten it up about as tight as i can
2:37
get it by hand and i've never had a
2:39
problem
2:43
all right now you can let your vehicle
2:44
back down so that it's level
2:47
all right so right here is where you're
2:48
gonna add your oil we're going to be
2:50
using 530
2:54
so
2:55
untwist that
2:59
it seems pretty tight but this is what
3:01
it is
3:03
and get yourself a funnel
3:05
stick it in there
3:07
fill her up
3:10
so this takes roughly four quarts what
3:12
you're gonna do
3:14
is pull your stick clean it off
3:17
stick it back in there and then make
3:19
sure it's between
3:20
the fill
3:22
or full and empty marks there see that
3:24
top hole towards the top of the stick
3:27
that's full
3:28
so that's where you want to get it
3:30
get it there start your engine let it
3:32
run for
3:34
i don't know 10 15 seconds shut it off
3:36
let it sit for a second check it again
3:39
make sure it's still full add any if you
3:41
need to
3:43
and
3:44
that is pretty much up pretty much it
