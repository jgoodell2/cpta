Hey guys Chrisfix here and today
0:01
I'm going to show you how to change the oil in your car or truck this video is
0:05
Specifically geared to beginners who have never done an oil change
0:09
So this is going to be an in-depth video and after watching it
0:12
You'll be able to change your own oil many
0:14
Inexpensive oil change shops will use cheap oil and really cheap filters so by [doing] an oil change yourself
0:19
You could use good motor oil [a] good filter and know the job is getting done
0:23
Right [plus] you get to save some money, and it's fun to work on your own car
 Tools
0:26
If you've ever done oil changes before and want to share your tips leave a comment now
0:32
Let's take a look at the tools
0:33
You need to change your oil
0:34
So here's everything you're going to need to change your oil you can see we're [just] using common hand tools
0:38
We have a socket set that has a ratchet and some sockets
0:42
Gloves so you don't get the oil on your skin because oil is not good [for] you paper towels to clean up
0:47
We have our oil and filter and I'll explain in a second how to find the correct oil
0:51
and the correct filter for your car
0:53
We have an oil filter wrench you might need it or you might not but it's worth to have just in case
0:57
We have an oil catch pan so you can recycle your old?
1:00
And a funnel so you can fill up your engine with new oil. I'm also including a breaker bar
1:04
Just in case your drain bolt is hard to get off [this] will make it really easy in
1:08
Addition to tools to change the oil you're also going to need something to jack your vehicle up in this case
1:13
We have ramps or you could use Jack and Jack stands and then a piece of wood to block off the rear tires
1:18
And I'll show you everything
1:20
There's also another method
1:21
You could use where you don't need any of this you could [just] drive your vehicle up onto the curb to get enough access to
1:26
Safely get underneath and drain the oil so you could use whatever method works for you
1:30
I just want to note also that any tools that I'm using here including the [Jack's] Jack stands Ramps and even the oil check the
1:38
description I'll link everything so if you don't have something you could easily find it and you can easily see what I used and as
1:44
Always if you have any questions throughout this process leave a comment below and I answer every question and comment
1:49
So by the end of this video you'll be an oil change expert
1:53
So let's go take a trip to the store and let me show you how to find out
1:56
What oil your car takes to figure out? What will your car takes?
 Oil
2:00
You can look in the [owner's] manual. So just go grab your owner's manual
2:07
We're going to flip to [the] back here. You look under oil and capacities
2:11
you can see it tells you how much oil you're going to need so we're going to need four and a quarter quarts and
2:17
then you want to check the viscosity the oil that you need and we're going to need four and a quarter quarts of
2:22
[0w] 20 so let's go to the store, and we'll check that out right now all right
2:26
We're in [the] store, and we need to find a synthetic 0w 20
2:30
there's a ton of oil to choose from
2:33
Here is 0w. 20. You can see here's where the viscosities are listed 0w 20 is right here
2:39
Here's 10w30 so make sure you get the correct viscosity. Here's the 0w 20. We need we want a full synthetic
2:46
We need at least 4 quarts in this container has 5 so that's plenty if you have an older car you might not need synthetic
2:52
But I personally like running synthetic oil even in my older cars
2:56
There are a lot of myths out there
2:57
I'm switching to synthetic and just so that you know you could switch to synthetic and you could switch back [to] conventional at any time
3:05
Conventional is cheaper
3:06
But on most new cars [Needle] run synthetic plus synthetic oil lasts longer
3:11
Speaking of how long [oil-less] change your oil at the recommended mileage that's listed in the [owner's] manual
3:16
many cars have an oil life monitor that will tell you when you need to change your oil so just go by that if you
3:22
Can't find any [information] on when you need to change your oil I change the oil in my cars at around 5,000 miles
3:27
My van has over three hundred thousand miles and we've had that car since new and she's still running great
3:33
Ok so we have our oil now let's go find the filter there are tons of oil filters
3:37
But which one do you pick well? Just look in the book here, and we're doing the oil change on a
3:43
2014 Nissan Sentra
3:46
personally I like using pure later filters, but any quality filter will do we need an L1 for
3:53
612
3:54
[Okay], L1
3:56
for 612
3:58
L1 for 612 right here good. So there we go
4:03
We got the oil and the filter I'm going to go check out real quick and let's go change the oil
4:08
Alright, so now that we got our correct
4:10
Viscosity Oil zero [w] 20 and we have the correct oil filter
4:14
Let's get underneath this car
4:16
And I'm going to show you how to jack the car up first
4:18
And then I'm going to use the ramps because that's what prefer [sew] an oil change has three basic parts
4:24
one you got to drain the oil two you have to change the oil filter and
4:28
Three you have to fill it with the correct new oil. Let's go step by step
4:32
So you know exactly what you need to do?
4:34
The first step is to drain the oil and to get to the oil drain plug. We have to go underneath the vehicle
 Jack Up
4:39
So we're going to have to lift the [vehicle] up to [jack] the car up if you're not completely sure how to do it you
4:44
Could check the owner's manual it tells you exactly how to jack the car up [to] change your spare tire
4:47
But I'm going to show you right here what you need to do and you
4:50
[want] to make sure before you jack the vehicle up you block off the rear tire
4:53
So the car doesn't roll the other thing you want to do is if you have an automatic
4:57
Make sure it's in park. [if] you have a manual put it in first gear and
5:01
Also pull the emergency brake which will prevent the car from Rolling
5:06
So get your jack and place it underneath the vehicle
5:09
Right where you're jacking points are in
5:11
this case the jacking points have these little indents in them that area of the frame is meant to support the vehicle and
5:17
Then you [could] Jack the car up
5:22
Once the car is jacked up. You can get your jack stands
5:27
and place it under the car right where there's a big piece [of] metal on the frame and
5:32
Then you're going to lower the car down into the jack stands and then you have plenty of room to get to the oil pin
5:38
So we'll just let the car down
5:41
slowly
5:42
and you can see
5:43
The Jack stand is the only thing holding it up and [once] your car safely supported on the jack stands
5:48
I always like to put the jack right back on the frame just for extra support
5:53
so for some reason the Jack stand slips or something or
5:56
Malfunctions you have back up with the jack you can never be too safe
6:00
So that's how you jack your car up [to] do an oil change
6:03
I want to show you the method that I prefer it's a lot easier [a] lot safer
6:06
And that's using ramps
6:08
Make sure you always use jack stands and not just the jack you
6:12
Don't want to just rely [on] the jack to protect you from the car falling on you like you saw I like to use both
6:18
Double the protection now using ramps is my favorite method
6:21
[it's] the easiest it's the safest and it also raises the vehicle pretty high
6:25
All you have to do is park the vehicle in a spot where [you] can slide two ramps right under the wheels
6:32
And then you just drive the car [off] the ramps. It's that simple
6:41
Make sure that you pull the emergency brake again, and we're blocking off the rear tires again
6:46
And I think you could get why I like the [ramps] so much before you go under the car even when [you] have the car
6:52
Jacked up what you want to do is you want to just shake the car with your hands?
6:55
the car should not move anywhere you're just shaking it back and forth as hard as you can and
6:59
It should be stable and this thing is stable once you know that the vehicle is safe to go under you can see why I?
7:04
Like using the ramps look at all this room that we have now
 Oil Drain Plug
7:08
All right, so now let's go under the car [and] find the oil drain plug
7:12
So you can see my feet over there
7:13
This is the front of the car right here, and then we're looking up here and if we look here
7:19
You can see there's a bunch of stuff and you might be confused. Oh, where's the boat that
7:23
I need to undo where's the oil drain bolt
7:24
Well what you want to do is you want to locate the drain pan the drain pan is this right here?
7:30
It's usually black and has a bolt coming out you can see the bolt right back here. That's your oil drain pan now
7:35
There's other things that look like it
7:37
But this should be pretty easy to find what you're looking for that bolt and you're looking for the black pan
7:42
But you could also see right here is another drain pan
7:44
But this drain pan here doesn't have any bolts to let fluid out. This is the transmission drain pan
7:50
so really simple to find the oil drain pan and then actually you can see right behind the drain pan you want to locate your
7:55
oil filter in this case oil drain pan here
7:58
Oil filter is right behind it and it's up and down nice and easy to get to which is really good in some vehicles
8:05
The oil Filter is actually on top of the engine [for] example in this Toyota tacoma. You can see here in
8:11
This case though, it's underneath
8:13
It's pretty easy to get to this is really easy to get to also you can see the drain plug right there
8:19
Let's go get it off
 Remove Oil Drain Plug
8:21
Now before we remove the drain plug get your oil collection pan
8:26
slide it under
8:28
Now we have a sideways view you can see our filters right here
8:31
Our [oil] drain pan is right here and our oil drain plug [is] right there we have our oil Catch-can right here
8:36
It's kind [of] aimed behind a little bit because the oil is going to come out that way in this case
8:42
we're using a 14 millimeter socket on our ratchet and
8:45
To loosen you want to go this way counterclockwise, Righty-tighty Lefty-Loosey
8:54
So this might be a problem some of you might encounter where you're using your normal size ratchet
8:59
It's hard to get that drain plug out. Well. Don't be discouraged. There's an easy trick to use and
9:05
That trick is to use one of these long breaker bars. You can see here
9:09
How much longer it is [than] my ratchet and this is going to give you so much leverage?
9:13
That's going to be really easy to get off if you don't have a long breaker bar like this you get your ratchet and slip
9:19
A pipe over the end to make it longer watch. How easy this is going to be now
9:24
Boom it's loosened. It's all it took
9:28
Now we can loosen this the rest of the way
9:31
Once it gets really loose. Make sure your drain pan is ready to go
9:36
And you can loosen this by hand
9:42
Now you [could] wait for all the oil to drain out
9:46
Now I should mention some people say you should change your oil after you run the car for like [10] [minutes]
9:51
So the oil is [warm] and it flows easier in reality
9:54
It doesn't [matter] if you want to change your oil with the car sitting there
9:57
You just [jack] it up and the car is cold all that oil is going to be in the oil pan
10:01
you're not going to risk burning yourself and
10:03
Sometimes it just makes the job
10:04
Easier now if you're going to put your car up on the ramps then you're starting your car anyway
10:08
Just make sure if you run your engine you let it sit for like five to [ten] minutes
10:12
Let it cool off a little bit so you don't burn yourself [and] also so all the oil collects in the drain pan on
10:18
Some oil drain plugs. There's a gasket to help seal the plug and you can see here
10:22
There's a copper crush gasket
10:24
These gaskets are generally one-time use so take off the old gasket and replace it with a new one
10:28
Some people have reused these gaskets one or two times and never have a problem with weeks, and I'm one of those people
10:33
But in general I suggest you replace the gasket all right the [oil] is completely drained
10:37
There are a few drops coming out
10:39
So let's screw in the drain plug and move on to the next step just [screw] it in by hand and it should tighten
10:45
Right up. [I] like to wipe away any extra [oil] before I tighten it [down] all the way
10:49
So your drain pan stays clean and so you know if there's any oil leaking from the drain plug down the road
10:57
Now we want to tighten up our drain plug and to do that. We want to go clockwise
11:02
So we're going to switch this so now we're going to tighten this clockwise
11:06
And notice I'm using our ratchet and not our breaker bar
11:09
You want to use the small ratchet to tighten this you're only tightening it so it's snug
11:14
You don't want it over tighten it you over tighten it
11:17
You'll strip the drain plug, and you'll cause way more problems. You have a washer [on] there
11:21
All you need to do is tighten it down to 20 foot-pounds of torque. Which is nothing so use the small ratchet
11:31
Tighten it and once. It's Snug give it a little extra turn and
11:36
That's it
11:37
So we just finished step one removing all the old oil now step two is changing the old oil filter
11:45
Okay, so we should be able to get this off by hand
11:48
Nope too tight, so if your oil filter is tight, and it won't come off
 Remove Oil Filter
11:53
We have four different style tools that you could [use] to get your oil filter off this one's my favorite
11:57
Because it works for all different sizes
11:59
It's literally just a wrench and it grabs on and then you could turn it this one put in here and then as you turn
12:07
You [could] see it gets smaller, but you can see this is a really small filter
12:11
This is for actually a big 454 cubic inch engine
12:15
So the oil filter on that is huge here's another adjustable one rubber. So it grabs on really tight
12:21
just close it by pulling the rubber through here and
12:25
Then when you turn to loosen you turn like this
12:28
and it kind of grips because it's
12:31
Turning on here and grabbing it these are good because they're adjustable and they work on all different sizes
12:35
And the last style is this style, but you need it for each specific size that you use, but this is a really small filter
12:43
So you can see it won't work
12:45
But the idea is it's just like a giant socket for a filter and then you could put your wrench right in here just
12:52
[like] that and then boom comes right off
12:55
But we're going to be using this because it's easy to use quick grabs on all different [size] filters, so let's get this filter off
13:09
Okay, you can see that does the trick we can unscrew this the rest of the way by hand make sure the oil catch can
13:15
Is right below where this is because this is going to leak oil as you can see
13:28
There we go. Let's put that right in there [all] [right] [so] [with] our old filter out. We want to grab our new filter and
13:37
I like to pre-oiled my filter it prevents the car from running dry when you first start it up
13:43
So if you just put this filter in now and screw it in there's no oil in here
13:46
So the oil has to fill this and then go to all the engine parts
13:50
But if we fill this first with our [brand-new] oil, then we don't have to worry about the engine running dry
13:55
And this is just going to give you a longer-lasting engine. [I] should also mention that not every car
14:00
You're going to be able to pre-fill these because [some] cars. It's upside down or some cars. It's in sideways
14:06
We just want to carefully fill this filter to the top
14:13
Just like that
14:15
Now what you want to do is you want to get oil around this gasket?
14:18
You can see a little bit of oil down on the gasket
14:20
Just by chance, but you want to make sure you have a clean finger
14:24
just get a
14:25
Little bit of oil and just put it right around this gasket
14:27
And what that's going to do is it's going to make it easier to come off next time you do this
14:31
It's also going to prevent leaks, and that's all you need to do now. Let's go install it so
14:37
[there's] the drain pin
14:39
We go up, and you look here, and that's what the oil filter adapter looks like and if we look there
14:44
You can see the [oil] filter
14:46
Screws right on to that middle stud there
14:49
So it screws in right there
14:54
And just try to make [it] flush as you turn it
14:57
So if it's flat as you turn it it should grab and you'll know when it grabs. You'll feel it don't force it
15:03
It should go on really easily
15:05
You can see there. It's on so now I just tighten it by hand
15:10
don't use any tools to tighten these just tighten it by hand [if]
15:13
Your hands are slippery [cuz] its oily you grab a towel clean it off and then turn it more by hand with the towel
15:21
Good
15:23
So step one is done. Step two changing the oil filter [is] done now
15:28
Let's get the car on the ground and do step three. Which is adding new oil
 Add Oil
15:33
So we're going to add the oil to the engine while we're on the ramps
15:36
Just so that we make sure that we don't start the engine with no oil in it and when you're looking for where your add?
15:41
Your oil it's usually at the top of the engine
15:44
[here] [is] where you check your [oil] you can see it says engine oil on here and
15:48
That's not where you fill it where you fill it is right up here as the oil sign
15:53
It's upside [down], but has the oil sign on here
15:55
And this is all dirty
15:56
so you don't want to just take this cap off you want to clean the area first because you don't want that junk falling into
16:01
The engine so just get your paper towel get in here and clean [it]
16:06
Good now [that] that's clean we can take this cap off
16:12
And we'll place our funnel right in here. So we could fill the engine up with brand new oil
16:18
so on the side of our bottle we have a scale here that tells you how many quarts or liters [you] have and
16:24
You want to do this on a level surface, but you can see we're pretty much full right now
16:27
And we need to add four quarts it was four and a quarter quarts with the filter
16:32
But we added the oil to the filter so it's really just four quarts so [we] want to have a quart left
16:37
Which is right down here I?
16:39
Always have a towel ready just in case [I] hate spilling oil on engine parts
16:45
this little top tip if you pour
16:47
it sideways like [this] you actually have a little more control surprisingly and
16:51
Usually the oil doesn't come out and blobs it comes out nice and smooth instead
16:56
So if we look here [we] have about a half a quart we need to add
17:04
And looks like we're at about one quart, so I'm going to stop there
17:15
Close that [up]
17:17
So we [just] finished the last step which is [idI] oil
17:20
We have one more step to do and that is to get the car off the jack stands or in this case the ramp on
17:26
Level [ground] and check the oil since we added oil we could start the car I
17:33
Just want to make sure that there's no oil lights on and you can see the oil light isn't on
17:39
So that means the engines getting oil now we could back the car down
17:47
And now that we have the car back down on level grounds. Let's go check the [oil] so shut the engine off
17:54
You want to let the engine sit for about five minutes so all the oil drops back down since we did start the engine after
18:00
You let it sit [for] five minutes [get] a towel
18:04
Pull your dipstick out and clean it off put it back in
18:10
Make sure it's pushed down all the way and then pull the dipstick back out
18:18
Okay, if we look at the dipstick what you're looking for is the oil you can see the oils over here
18:23
There's low and there's high so that dot right [there] means that the oil is low
18:28
And you need to fill it up that dot right [there] means the oil is high and it means that you have it completely full
18:34
Anywhere in between is good
18:36
I prefer trying to get it to the high now sometimes it's hard to see how much oil is on here
18:40
Especially this brand new oil and especially the synthetic oil
18:43
So if you flip this over you actually get a better look and you can see the oil
18:49
goes right there
18:50
So we're right on the high which is perfect so we don't have to add oil or anything [if] yours is too
18:57
Low add a little bit of oil and check the level again if you end up adding a little bit too much oil
19:02
That's not a big deal if you add over a quart of extra oil, then you have a problem
19:06
And you probably have to remove some of it because that could actually cause engine problems
19:10
And that is the complete guide to changing oil in your car or truck hopefully after this video you have no questions
19:17
but if you do have questions
19:18
Just comment below
19:19
I answer every comment in question also if you end up doing your first oil change after watching this video
19:24
Definitely, let me know because I love to hear that stuff
19:27
hopefully [this] video is helpful for
19:28
Remember to give it a thumbs up up on the screen are going to be other videos you can find the links to those videos
19:33
As well as any links to any tools that I used in this video in the description
19:38
The top tip for this video is well
19:40
where do I put [all] my oil that I drained out from my filter and
19:44
From the car and the [answer] to that is you want to dispose all of your oil?
19:48
Responsibly you can see here in the corner of my garage. I have all these old oil containers
19:53
I really need to make an oil run, but what you do is you just fill up a container
19:56
[it] could be an old oil container. It could be a milk container orange juice
20:01
Whatever you have and what you do is you just fill up these containers and you go to your local auto parts store
20:06
Your local garage
20:07
Your local recycle center
20:09
Places that sell the oil like Walmart most of those places will take the oil [and] they'll take it for free so that they could
20:15
Recycle it. So it doesn't become an environmental Hazard
